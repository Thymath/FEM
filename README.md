# FEM
This library will be able to calculate solutions for solving the finite element method.

## TODO

### Mesh Related
- Triangles have to be defined.
- Properties of the mesh.
- Integration of a reference triangle.
- Integration of a triangle that is not the reference one.

#### Nice to have
- Triangularization of a regular polygon.
- Triangularization of a non-regular polygon.
- Mesh refinement by size of triangle.
- Mesh refinement by error.
